    "In machine learning, a kernel function is a way of implicitly mapping data points into a higher-dimensional space without explicitly calculating the transformation. Polynomial kernel functions are a type of kernel that uses polynomial functions to achieve this mapping.

    "The choice of the kernel function determines the mapping of data into a higher-dimensional space. Common choices include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The appropriate kernel depends on the characteristics of the data.\n",
    "C Parameter: The C parameter is the regularization parameter. A smaller C encourages a smoother decision boundary, allowing more errors within the tube.\n",
    "Epsilon Parameter : The epsilon parameter defines the width of the tube around the regression line. A larger allows more data points to be within the tube without contributing to the loss.\n",
    "Gamma Parameter: The gamma parameter influences the shape of the decision boundary. A smaller gamma leads to a softer, more extended decision boundary, while a larger gamma results in a more complex, tightly fitted boundary. "
