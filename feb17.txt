Ans1
MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
Non-Relational Databases:
Structure: No fixed schema; data can be inserted without predefined structure.
Scalability: Easily scalable horizontally by adding more servers.
Types: Various types like document stores, key-value stores, wide-column stores, graph databases.
Schema Flexibility: Dynamic schema allows fields to vary for each document.

Ans2
Document-Oriented: Stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON documents.
Dynamic Schema: Documents in a collection can have different fields.
Indexing: Supports various types of indexes to improve query performance.
Replication: Provides high availability through replica sets.

from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connecting to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")

# Creating a database
mydb = client["mydatabase"]

# Creating a collection
mycollection = mydb["mycollection"]

Ans4
# Inserting one record
record_one = {"name": "piyush", "age": 25, "city": "Delhi"}
mycollection.insert_one(record_one)

# Inserting many records
records_many = [
    {"name": "Ram", "age": 30, "city": "Mumbai"},
    {"name": "Rahul", "age": 22, "city": "Banglore"}
]
mycollection.insert_many(records_many)

Ans5
Querying Based on a Condition:
result_query = mycollection.find({"age": {"$gt": 25}})
for record in result_query:
    print("Query Result:", record)

Ans6
Sorting in Ascending Order:

result_sort_asc = mycollection.find().sort("age")
for record in result_sort_asc:
    print("Sorted Result (Asc):", record)

# Sorting in Descending Order:
result_sort_desc = mycollection.find().sort("age", -1)
for record in result_sort_desc:
    print("Sorted Result (Desc):", record)
