Copy code
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);
Foreign Key: A foreign key establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
