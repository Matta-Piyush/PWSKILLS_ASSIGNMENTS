    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning where a model is trained by combining the predictions of multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random chance). Unlike bagging, which builds parallel models independently, boosting builds models sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessors. The goal is to create a strong learner that performs well on the overall task."
