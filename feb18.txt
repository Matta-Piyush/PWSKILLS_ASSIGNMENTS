API (Application Programming Interface): An API is a set of rules that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

ans2
Advantages:
Interoperability: Enables communication and data exchange between different systems.
Modularity: Allows developers to use pre-built components, enhancing efficiency.
Easier Development: Reduces development time and effort by providing ready-made functionality.
Disadvantages:
Dependency: Applications relying on external APIs may be affected if the API changes.
Limited Functionality: APIs may not provide all the functionality needed for a specific use case.
Security Concerns: Poorly implemented or unauthorized use of APIs can pose security risks.

Web API: A Web API, or web service, is an API accessible over the web using standard protocols such as HTTP. It allows different software applications to communicate over the internet.

Difference Between API and Web API:

API: A broader term encompassing various types of interfaces, including those not necessarily web-based.
Web API: Specifically refers to APIs accessible over the web using standard web protocols.

REST (Representational State Transfer):

Architecture: Stateless client-server architecture.
Communication: Relies on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Data Format: Typically uses JSON for data format.
Stateless: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

Architecture: Follows a more rigid, protocol-based approach.
Communication: Can use various protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and more.
Data Format: Uses XML for data format.
Stateful: Can maintain state information between requests.
